									<h2 class="major">My Interests</h2>
									<p>I'm a year 2 university student majoring in Computer Science. My current university is the National University of Singapore. I consider myself to be motivated, self sufficient, and being very willing to learn.
										I love working out, I tend to enjoy scenic views, I'm not a huge fan of craft beer, I play video games at times, I was a lifeguard, my favourite food is junk food and I wish I could travel to Japan more frequently.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Game Development</h3>
											<p>I've been interested in game development for the longest time.
												In particular, I've always enjoyed the ideation process of brainstorming for
												revolutionary ideas that people would take to. I'm a current member of the
												NUS Game Development Group.

											<h3 class="major">Fitness</h3>
											<p>I'm passionate about positive change, but also about maintaining health.
												I believe that fitness pours over into many aspects of life. As such, 
												I visit the gym at least 3 times a week, and do ab workouts on the daily.
												Also, I feel guilty if I do skip a session. I really do.
											</p>

											<h3 class="major">Software Engineering</h3>
											<p>Needless to say, I'm passionate about coding. I'm also interested in problem solving.
												Specifically, the implementation of ideas. More importantly, I'm a firm believer of clean code.
												Ever since I read Clean Code by Robert Martin, I've been obsessed with making sure that my code
												<i>(and sometimes, others)</i> is readable. 
											</p>

											<h3 class="major">Writing</h3>
											<p>I really enjoy the ideation process of things. Writing was one of my hobbies since National Service,
												but coding has filled the free time up since then. The pride of having others critique your work for the
												better or worse is another fuel to my passion of writing.
